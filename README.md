# React YouTube Viewer

A React and Redux project based on the Udemy lessons of Stephen Grider.
This video viewing app allows a user to enter a search topic and will make an API call to YouTube to return the top results for the search terms. Users can click on any of the returned results to view them in the larger viewing pane.


## Technology:
* JavaScript (ES6)
* React and Redux
* Bootstrap
* YouTube API


## How to Use the React YouTube Viewer

The page will automatically load with an initial search of kittens so that an empty page will not be displayed when first loading. Enter a search term in the search field.

Once the search is complete, results will be displayed and the chosen clip can be played from within the app.
